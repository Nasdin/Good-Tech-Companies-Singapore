>Choose own work hours, flexible entry and exit times or the ability to take time whenever during a workday
for personal appointments without consuming leaves. Or to work at home on any moment's notice
2. __Mid-level__
    
>Someone who is in their mid to late 20s. Past the junior phase and has 2-4 years experience.
But 5 years and above can command a much higher salary; they would have "senior" or "lead" in their titles.
