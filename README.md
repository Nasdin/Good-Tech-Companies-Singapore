#### Definitions
1. __Flexible hours__

>Choose own work hours, flexible entry and exit times or the ability to take time whenever during a workday
for personal appointments without consuming leaves. Or to work at home on any moment's notice
2. __Mid-level__

>Someone who is in their mid to late 20s. Past the junior phase and has 2-4 years experience.
But 5 years and above can command a much higher salary; they would have "senior" or "lead" in their titles.

3. __Striked through__

>This company has fallen below certain standards and is in the grey area of a good tier tech company

4. __Very good pantry__

> Generally means a never ending flowing pantry, topped up DAILY with premium ice cream of any kind, drinks, bars,
magnum ice-cream, free flow alcohol. Milo, coconut water etc. Non-junk snacks, Good would be similar but slightly lower.
Use your imagination to figure out the other ranges.
